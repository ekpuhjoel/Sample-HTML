	<h3> The Journey So Far</h3>
	<!-- paragraph 1 -->
	<p> "A journey of a thousand miles they say begins with a step in the right direction", this was the testimony of the golden hands bakery. for so long it had been a dream of the CEO and founder of the company <strong> Mr. Johnbull Ekpuh</strong> but exactly on the 17th of November 2019, this dream came to reallity. </p>
	<p> Of corse like every other journey has its ups and downs, The Golden Hands bakery had it fair share of both, starting with the disappearance of one of its workers with a huge sum of money just few days after the inception of the company. Some would have thought that after such an occurence, the company would hit brick wall. <strong>Absolutely not!</strong> rather, the business took back its fit on a much more stronger foundation and since then only good testimonies have echoed out of there. </p>
